By: Gavin Trebilcock, Joshua Lieshout, Max Newall, Shaye Mckay


Seasons is a game where you play as a character on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean with no other land in sight. You must survive the elements and prepare yourself for the cold winters and the hot summers ahead. Using the island's resources at your disposal you must make wise decisions on how to best spend your time, as you might fall short of resources and supplies to stay alive.
